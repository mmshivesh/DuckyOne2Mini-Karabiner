# DuckyOne2Mini-Karabiner

Ducky One2 Mini Remapping for Karabiner Elements that emulates the TAP Layout feature in Anne Pro 2 keyboards.

## Usage:

1. Verify the VendorID and the ProductID in the ducky.json matches with your keyboard's vendor and product ID. (Can be checked from the System Information app under `USB → <Keyboard Name>`).
2. Ensure the file is in the correct location `~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications/`.
3. Load the Complex modification from Karabiner Elements app.

## Normal Layout:

## Karabiner Complex Modification:

1. Tapping the key will work as an arrow key. Holding it/using it for keyboard shortcuts with any other key will let it work as the original key.
